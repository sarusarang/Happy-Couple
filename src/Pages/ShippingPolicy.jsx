                <h2>3. Temperature-Sensitive and Fragile Medical Products</h2>
                <p>
                    Many of the medical products we sell require special care during shipping to ensure that they reach you in perfect condition. We take special precautions when shipping temperature-sensitive or fragile items.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Temperature-Controlled Products:</strong> For products that need to be kept at specific temperatures (such as medications, vaccines, or supplements), we use insulated packaging and cold packs to maintain the correct temperature during transit. The packaging is designed to keep the products safe for up to 48 hours.</li>
                    <li><strong>Fragile Items:</strong> For fragile medical devices or products that are susceptible to damage, we use protective packaging to ensure they are not damaged during transportation. These items are handled with care to prevent breakage or malfunction.</li>
                    <li><strong>Time-Sensitive Deliveries:</strong> In cases where time-sensitive medical products are ordered, we recommend opting for Express Shipping to reduce transit time and ensure the product’s efficacy is maintained.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>4. Order Tracking</h2>
                <p>
                    Once your order has been shipped, we will provide you with a tracking number via email. This tracking number will allow you to monitor the status of your shipment and know exactly when your package will arrive.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Tracking Information:</strong> You can track your order directly on our website or by visiting the shipping carrier’s website. Tracking information is updated in real-time, but please allow 24 hours from the time of shipping for the tracking number to become active.</li>

                </ul>

                <h2>5. Shipping Restrictions</h2>
                <p>
                    While we strive to provide nationwide coverage, there are some locations where delivery might be restricted due to carrier limitations or regulatory constraints on medical products. If your address falls into a restricted area, you will be notified during checkout or shortly after placing the order.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>P.O. Boxes:</strong> We do not ship to P.O. boxes for medical products due to the sensitive nature of some items. Please ensure that a physical address is provided for accurate delivery.</li>

                <p>
